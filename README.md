# mysql-docker

## Very simple mysql docker image

Create a dockerized MySQL server ready to connect with some basic database grants set up. 
A few convenience scripts are provided to build the image and run/kill the container.

This docker container is an alternative to my mysql-vagrant project for the sake of speed.
Setting up a docker container ist just so much more speedy. 

The supplied ctr.sh script can be used to (build / run / provision / remove) the container.

To get an overview, execute 

```
./ctr.sh
```
